# Variables

There are four types of variables:
- **Instance variable** (non static fields): objects store their individual states in 'non static field' (can be accessed through the instance)
- **Class variable** (static fields): any field declared with the static modifier (it tells the compiler that there is excatly one copy of this variable in existence), these fields share its values among all of the class' object (instance) 
- **Local Variable**: a method often store its temporary state in local variables (depends on the location in which the variable is declared)
	are only visible to the methods in which they are declared, they are not accessible from the rest of the class
- **Parameters**: declared in the methods specifications
